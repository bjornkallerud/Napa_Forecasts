["forecasting-methodology.html", "2 Forecasting Methodology", " 2 Forecasting Methodology To forecast aggregate usage, we independently derive forecasts for the number of accounts and per-account usage. Utilizing agency-level aggregated monthly data, we regress the number of accounts on time for each agency/class combination with the following model: accountst, d, s = β0 + β1date + ϵt, d, s where accountst, d is the number of accounts for service s (water or sewer), in division d in time t, β0 is the intercept, and ϵt, d is an error term. In this model, β1 represents the time trend for accounts. We simulataneously forecasted per-account usage according to the following econometric specification: ut, d, s = β0 + β1date + β2precipt + β3ETt + Drought2015 + ϵt, d, s where ut, d, s is per-account usage for service s in time t for division d. We normalize for weather by including precipitation (precipt) and ET (ETt) and Drought2015 is an indicator variable for observations within the mandatory drought restriction time period to control for artificial deviations in demand. Per-account usage has been declining statewide in recent years because of behavioral changes stemming from water shortage concerns as well as the implementation of increasingly efficient appliances. Although this trend is likely to continue, there is a limit for how much water consumption can reduce because of the vital role water plays in daily life. Because of this, we impose a lower bound on per-account consumption reduction in our model. Currently, the lower bound is defined as 70% of the average per-account usage level for the specified month. The forecasts in this report utilize median ET and precipitation values by month from the CIMIS data dating back to 2006. In the accompanying .csv files, wet and dry year forecasts are included. A wet year is defined as year in which ET in all months is equivalent to the 25th percentile of ET values for that specific month, while precipitation values are the 75th percentile of precipitation values for that month. Alternatively, a dry year is defined in a similar fashion, except with the percentile values for ET and precipitation switched. "],
["lbrid.html", "3 LBRID 3.1 Introduction 3.2 Historical Data 3.3 Forecasting", " 3 LBRID 3.1 Introduction The districts bill customers on an overlapping bi-monthly schedule. LBRID bills their customers in even-numbered months, utilizing a two-tiered rate structure. The first 8,000 gallons of water bi-monthly (or 4,000 gallons monthly) are included in the fixed bi-monthly charge. All usage above 8,000 gallons is charged at $3.85 per 1,000 gallons. For the purpose of this study, RDN defined the District’s rates as a two-tiered increasing block rate strucutre wherein customers pay $0 for the first 8,000 gallons of water (Tier 1) and $3.85 per 1,000 gallons (Tier 2) thereafter. LBRID rates were last increased 1 July, 2013. Most LBRID customers also have a sewer connection. A similar two-tiered rate structure is also implemented for LBRID sewer accounts - customers are allocated 4,000 gallons with their fixed charge and pay $5.50 per 1,000 gallons over this amount, capped at 6,000 gallons per month (which is the estimate of per-account winter residential waste flows). It follows that the maximum variable charge for a sewer customer would be $11.00 (4,000 gallons at $0.00 and 2,000 gallons at $5.50). RDN backed out sewer consumption from metered use by assuming that sewer consumption is equal to metered water consumption if metered water consumption is less than or equal to 12,000 gallons for the bi-monthly meter read and 12,000 gallons if metered water consumption is above 12,000 gallons for a given two-month period. 3.2 Historical Data 3.2.1 Total Usage Table 3.1: Historical Consumption (Acre-Feet) District Service FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 LBRID Sewer 19.8 16.9 18.3 19.1 19.9 20.2 LBRID Water 26.8 22.4 22.8 24.1 25.2 25.8 Figure 3.1: LBRID Historical Metered Water and Sewer Consumption 3.2.2 Number of Accounts Table 3.2: Historical Accounts District Service FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 LBRID Sewer Accounts 163 163 168 178 181 185 LBRID Water Accounts 180 165 178 187 191 195 Figure 3.2: LBRID Historical Number of Accounts 3.2.3 Per-Account Usage Table 3.3: Historical PA Consumption (Thousands of Gallons) District Service FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 LBRID Per-Account Sewer 6.6 5.6 6.0 6.0 6.1 6.0 LBRID Per-Account Water 8.2 7.1 7.2 7.1 7.4 7.3 Figure 3.3: LBRID Historical Per-Account Consumption 3.3 Forecasting In this section we forecast accounts, per-account consumption, and aggregate usage for LBRID Water and Sewer accounts. 3.3.1 Water 3.3.1.1 Accounts Table 3.4: Forecasted Accounts District FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25 FY26 LBRID 197 201 204 208 211 215 Figure 3.4: LBRID Forecasted Water Accounts 3.3.1.2 Per-Account Consumption Table 3.5: Forecasted Per-Account Consumption (Thousands of Gallons) District FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25 FY26 LBRID 7.9 7.9 7.9 8.0 8.0 8.0 Figure 3.5: LBRID Forecasted Per-Account Water Consumption 3.3.1.3 Aggregate Consumption Table 3.6: Forecasted Consumption (Acre-Feet) District FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25 FY26 LBRID 28.3 29.0 29.6 30.2 30.9 31.5 Figure 3.6: LBRID Forecasted Aggregate Water Consumption 3.3.2 Sewer Table 3.7: Forecasted Accounts District FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25 FY26 LBRID 190 194 198 201 205 209 Figure 3.7: LBRID Forecasted Sewer Accounts 3.3.2.1 Per-Account Consumption Table 3.8: Forecasted Per-Account Consumption (Thousands of Gallons) District FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25 FY26 LBRID 6.1 6.1 6.1 6.1 6.1 6.1 Figure 3.8: LBRID Forecasted Per-Account Sewer Consumption 3.3.2.2 Aggregate Consumption Table 3.9: Forecasted Consumption (Acre-Feet) District FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25 FY26 LBRID 21.3 21.7 22.1 22.4 22.8 23.2 Figure 3.9: LBRID Forecasted Aggregate Sewer Consumption "],
["nbrid.html", "4 NBRID 4.1 Introduction 4.2 Historical Data 4.3 Forecasting", " 4 NBRID 4.1 Introduction NBRID employs a similar two-tiered rate structure for water and sewer customers, albeit it with different allocation levels and nominal rates. NBRID customers pay no variable charge for their first 2,000 gallons bi-monthly (or 1,000 gallons monthly), and are charged $4.00 per 1,000 gallons above this usage level. With respect to sewer rates, NBRID also caps sewer usage at 6,000 gallons per month. However, NBRID allocates only 1,000 gallons to the no-charge Tier 1 usage. All subsequent usage is billed at $8.00 per 1,000 gallons. 4.2 Historical Data 4.2.1 Total Usage Table 4.1: Historical Consumption (Acre-Feet) District Service FY13 FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 NBRID Sewer 15.6 34.6 34.0 31.7 32.9 34.5 32.7 NBRID Water 20.8 53.3 54.5 49.0 45.4 49.5 50.8 Figure 4.1: NBRID Historical Metered Water and Sewer Consumption 4.2.2 Number of Accounts Table 4.2: Historical Accounts District Service FY13 FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 NBRID Sewer Accounts 308 323 332 333 338 344 336 NBRID Water Accounts 308 330 332 337 341 348 340 Figure 4.2: NBRID Historical Number of Accounts 4.2.3 Per-Account Usage Table 4.3: Historical PA Consumption (Thousands of Gallons) District Service FY13 FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 NBRID Per-Account Sewer 5.5 6.0 5.6 5.2 5.3 5.5 5.3 NBRID Per-Account Water 7.3 9.1 8.9 8.0 7.2 7.8 8.2 Figure 4.3: NBRID Historical Per-Account Consumption 4.3 Forecasting 4.3.1 Water 4.3.1.1 Accounts Table 4.4: Forecasted Accounts District FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25 FY26 NBRID 339 342 346 349 353 356 Figure 4.4: NBRID Forecasted Water Accounts 4.3.1.2 Per-Account Consumption Table 4.5: Forecasted Per-Account Consumption (Thousands of Gallons) District FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25 FY26 NBRID 7.9 7.8 7.7 7.6 7.5 7.4 Figure 4.5: NBRID Forecasted Per-Account Water Consumption 4.3.1.3 Aggregate Consumption Table 4.6: Forecasted Consumption (Acre-Feet) District FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25 FY26 NBRID 49.0 49.0 48.9 48.8 48.7 48.5 Figure 4.6: NBRID Forecasted Aggregate Water Consumption 4.3.2 Sewer Table 4.7: Forecasted Accounts District FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25 FY26 NBRID 335 338 341 344 347 350 Figure 4.7: NBRID Forecasted Sewer Accounts 4.3.2.1 Per-Account Consumption Table 4.8: Forecasted Per-Account Consumption (Thousands of Gallons) District FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25 FY26 NBRID 5.4 5.3 5.3 5.2 5.2 5.1 Figure 4.8: NBRID Forecasted Per-Account Sewer Consumption 4.3.2.2 Aggregate Consumption Table 4.9: Forecasted Consumption (Acre-Feet) District FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25 FY26 NBRID 33.1 33.1 33.0 33.0 33.0 32.9 Figure 4.9: NBRID Forecasted Aggregate Sewer Consumption "]
